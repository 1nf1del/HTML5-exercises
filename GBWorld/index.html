                Bootstrapping Design has left for that big dusty bookshelf up in the sky. </p>
            <p> It's no longer for sale. </p>
            <p> <strong>But now there is a better way for you to learn about design.</strong> The book has found new life in a higher form. </p>
            <p>Bootstrapping Design was a decent book, or at least many of the thousands of people who bought it said they liked it. </p>
            <p>But ultimately it was not enough. 5 years of conversations with readers taught me that Bootstrapping Design really only scratched the surface of common challenges in learning design. </p>
            <p>In the book I wrote that to become good at design you need to practice. I wrote that design is more about skill than knowledge. And then, I proceeded to provide only knowledge. To truly learn design and make good design, you need more than a book. </p>
            <p>You need more than tips, theories, and information. You need experience, advice, and mentorship. </p>
            <p> That's why I have cannibalized Bootstrapping Design, and made a better way for you to learn and practice design.

                To replace Bootstrapping Design, I am writing a design course called TheorySprints. </p>
            <p> This course includes all the principles I taught in Bootstrapping Design, but also builds upon the ebook by teaching in more depth and then showing how to use the principles in video demonstrations.</p>
            <p> TheorySprints also includes Portfolio Builder Project Briefs to guide you in practicing what you learn, because, as I wrote in Bootstrapping Design, practice is the most important part of learning design. <a href="#"> Learn about TheorySprints, the successor to Bootstrapping Design </a> </p>
            <p>Thanks for visiting this site. You can also <a href="#">read my latest writing about design over here. </a> </p>
